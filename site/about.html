                    <h1>This website</h1>
                    <p>
                        This website is made with <a href="https://panr.github.io/terminal-css/">Terminal.css</a> for preset semantic styles.
                        Other than Terminal.css, I didn't use any frameworks or libraries.
                        The rest of this website is written in vanilla HTML.
                        This website is also 100% JavaScript free!
                        No node_modules, no webpack, no jsx, no npm, not even vanilla JavaScript.
                        It's indeed a breath of fresh air!
                        Just a bunch of HTML, CSS and other static files as if it's a blog in the 90s.
                        Very simple. And it's beautiful. Also, I should have used a Static Site Generator.
                    </p>

                    <h1>Philosphy</h1>
                    <p>Even though I reminisce writing CSS by hand from time to time, I do not want to fight CSS every time I want to update something on this site.
                       I consider the bones and structure of this site done, only having to occasionally add or update some details without having to touch CSS.
                       It's not that I hate CSS, I just want my future self to have a straightforward way of adding or editing details into this site without having to redesign heavily again.
                       We know how notorious  CSS is.
                       <br><br>
                       More importantly, I believe that simple is elegant. Simple in a way that it is easy to maintain and understand without having the website fight the developer or the user.
                       I value longevity more than style, and substance over style.
                       Some things are not boring, just optimized.
                    </p>

                    <h1>AI/LLM Use</h1>
                    <p>
                        I didn't use any sort of LLMs to express my notions anywhere in this site.
                        Not even for CSS. The only time I had to use LLM was to generate the necessary meta tags in the HTML head.
                        Apart from that, there are no other AI-generated content that can be found in this site.
                    </p>
