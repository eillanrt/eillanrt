# Hi!
I am a Computer Engineering student based in the Philippines.
Our curriculum focuses on Hardware programming and the practical use and strengths of programmable logic devices, primarily FPGAs.

I am currently exploring the possibilities of the Semiconductor world and on how they interact with reality though embedded systems and software interfacing. We use Verilog for Hardware Description and Quartus for designing and synthesizing programmable logic devices. I also find myself knowledgeable in programming in Python, JavaScript, and C++.

I have also spend a fair amount of time in Web Development and the Linux Operating System.
